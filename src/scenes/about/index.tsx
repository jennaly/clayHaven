              Clay Haven Studio was founded in 1921 by a group of passionate
              potters who wanted to create a space where they could gather and
              share their love for pottery-making. Originally located in a small
              basement, the studio quickly grew in popularity, and it wasn't
              long before they moved to a larger space on the outskirts of town.
            </p>
            <p>
              Over the years, the studio has seen many changes, but one thing
              has remained constant â€“ our commitment to promoting the art and
              craft of pottery-making.
            </p>
            <p>
              Today, Clay Haven continues to be a hub for pottery enthusiasts
              and artists from all over the world. We're proud to have played a
              role in the development of the art of pottery-making, and we look
              forward to empowering the next generation of potters for many
              years to come.
